# Traj-VLMPC

This is the official repo for our paper: 

Vision-Language Model Predictive Control for Manipulation Planning and Trajectory Generation ( [Jiaming Chen*](https://ppjmchen.github.io/), [Wentao Zhao*](https://taoshuaiz.github.io/) ,Ziyu Meng, Donghui Mao, [Ran Songâ€ ](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/songran/en/index/1023305/list/index.htm), [Wei Pan](https://panweihit.github.io/) , Wei Zhang )



## Note
We provide the implementation of Traj-VLMPC in Real-World seetings. Thus, you are supposed to create your own robot environment and camera api.
